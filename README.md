# ATMLogic

Note: Please do not claim my work as your own. Solving coding scenarios like these will only build on your coding skills.

I implemented this partial ATM Project  as part of a preliminary coding project conducted by a major e-commerce company. Please utilize my work as a guidance tool or in preparation for similar projects.  Simulating an autonomous ATM requires considering facets beyond the code itself, but rather its logical simplicity, structure, and maintainability. Most importantly, we must not forget that optimization also plays a critical role in assembly.

Resources and Java Archives
You can run this project with any popular IDE environment you already have installed on your computer, such as IntelliJ, Eclipse, or NetBeans. If you do not have any of the IDEs mentioned above, go to the website of your IDE of choice to download the most recent version. This project will only run on JDK 17 or higher as it incorporates new features only accessible via Java 17+ libraries. This project utilizes a basic YAML data file to relay the concept. However, in real-world situations depending on client specifications a Docker container maybe preferable. Although, logical concepts are covered the project still offers a console interface for basic interactions to aid in the learning experience. The codes cognitive complexity scored low for optimal readability.
